    <h3>Amancio Ortega Gaona -founder and former chairman of Inditex fashion group</h3>
    <div class="container3">
        <div>
            <p class="introz2">Amancio Ortega, the Founding Chair of retail giant Inditex, the parent company of Zara, the largest global fashion retailer, is the wealthiest person in Spain and one of the wealthiest people in the world.  <br> <br> ndustria de Diseño Textil, S.A. (Inditex; /ˌɪndɪˈtɛks/, Spanish: [indiˈteks]; lit. 'Textile Design Industry') is a Spanish multinational clothing company headquartered in Arteixo, Galicia, in Spain. <br> Inditex, the biggest fast fashion group in the world, operates over 7,200 stores in 93 markets worldwide. The company's flagship store is Zara, but it also owns a number of other brands such as   Zara Home, Bershka, Massimo Dutti, Oysho, Pull&Bear, Stradivarius, Uterqüe and Lefties. <br> <br> The majority of its stores are corporate-owned, while franchises are mainly conceded in countries where corporate properties cannot be foreign-owned. <br> <br>
                Ortega built a retail empire as one of the earliest and most successful pioneers of fast fashion—a retail concept based on the rapid production and distribution of inexpensive versions of designs copied directly from fashion runways or pop culture icons.

            <p class="introz2">Ortega, who dropped out of school at the age of 13, founded the company that grew into the retail giant Inditex as a workshop in his home in Spain in 1963. When he made the leap from production to retail with the launch of the first Zara store in 1975, the concept of getting garments from the idea stage to the sales floor within two weeks was so successful that it shook up the retail fashion industry. From that point on, the Zara brand launched Ortega on a trajectory that would make him the most successful fashion retailer in the world. New Zara stores opened across Spain in the 1980s, followed by the incorporation of Inditex in 1985, and a series of international store openings, brand expansions, and acquisitions throughout the 1990s.

                In 1963, Ortega founded the company that grew into the retail giant Inditex as a small family workshop in his home in Spain—and within four decades, he grew the business into one of the largest fashion retailers in the world. <br>
                In 2001, when Inditex was listed on the Madrid Stock Exchange with a valuation of €9 billion, Ortega became a billionaire.

            <p class="introz2">Amancio Ortega Gaona was born in a small village in northern Spain in 1936, at the start of the Spanish Civil War, and moved with his family to Galicia, a region in northwestern Spain, in 1949. His father was an itinerant railway worker, his mother worked as a maid, and the family lived in a row house on the railroad tracks. <br> According to the only authorized biography of Ortega, his lifelong drive for success was triggered by a traumatic incident that happened shortly after the family arrived in their new town. One evening, as he was walking home with his mother, he witnessed her pleading for credit to buy groceries and coming out of the store empty-handed because the store owner refused to extend her line. At that moment, Ortega was so humiliated that he decided he would drop out of school and start working—a decision that turned out to be the first step in one of the greatest retail careers in history.
            <br> In 1949, at the age of 13, Ortega went to work as an assistant to a luxury shirtmaker in his hometown of La Coruña, where he learned to make clothes by hand. Over the next 14 years, as he was promoted to Assistant Manager and Shop Manager, he had direct experience not only dealing with customers but also purchasing fabrics and other supplies to manufacture apparel.
