    <h3>Zara Brands Clothing Process From Manufacturing To Hanging In The Store</h3>
    <div class="container2">
        <div>
            <p class="introz2">The story begins in the heart of Zara's headquarters, where its 300-person design team is
                leafing through trend-forecasting books and putting together mood boards for the store's next
                collection.
                Once a design is created, it is taken to a team of pattern cutters just meters away, who put together
                the first prototypes.

        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="introz2">Once the prototype has been created, it is tested on models who are also full-time
                Inditex employees working in other areas of the fashion department.There are almost 10 models there to
                test the various collections of men's and women's clothing.

        <div>
            <p class="introz2">Once the prototype has been signed off on, a digitalized pattern is sent to one of its
                factories.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="introz2">Its sprawling, 860,000-square-foot campus is home to 10 different factories, which
                manufacture Zara's most fashion-forward items of clothing â€” basically, the products that need more
                attention, a spokesperson said. These factories are connected to the distribution center through a
                network of secret underground tunnels that transport clothing on electric hanging rails.Other items are
                sent to external factories around the world.

            <p class="introz2">The factory that we visited solely manufacturers clothing for Zara's womenswear
                collection. The first step of the process is to set the patterns to the fabric.

        <div>
            <p class="introz2">The pattern layout is then sent to a machine that prints a life-size copy, using the
                relevant information about what part of the garment each piece is.

        <div>
            <p class="introz2">The fabric is laid out under large cutting machines, and the paper is placed on top.Both
                materials are held in place with a tight plastic sheet. The machine slices through the material, cutting
                out the individual pieces of fabric.On thinner fabrics, 200 layers can be cut at one time.

        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="introz2">Once they have been cut, the paper and fabric pieces are boxed up together. The paper has
                all the details for the factory workers to see where these pieces need to be sent next, and which part
                of the garment they will make up.

        <div>
            <p class="introz2">These pieces are sent to external factories to be sewn together, along with a prototype
                of the item so that the factories can copy the exact design.Once the item is sewn together, it returns
                to Zara's headquarters.

            <p class="introz2"> <strong>Zara's more expensive items</strong> and its <strong>key products</strong> are
                sent back to the factory for individual quality checks.Pressing machines are used to flatten out the
                material.Sleeves are blasted with hot air to shape the fabric and stretch the stitching.

        <div>
            <p class="introz2"> <strong>Each item is individually ironed.</strong> The clothing is then checked piece by
                piece . to ensure there are no faulty stitches. Items that pass the checks are given a security tag.If any issues are spotted in this process, the clothing is put to one side.  and any small faults are fixed on sewing machines.

            <p class="introz2">Any items that have been created in external factories and are not considered to be "fashion-forward" but more straightforward designs, are sent directly to the distribution center. Zara relies on the external factories to do quality-control checks on these items, though spot checks are also done."We can't check one-for-one because there are millions; it's impossible," the Zara Staff said.
